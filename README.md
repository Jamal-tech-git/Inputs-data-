# Inputs-data

This repository contains input and supporting data files used in our recently submitted article to PCCP involving "Modelling Silica using MACE-MP Machine Learnt Interatomic Potentials" for zeolite and silica materials modelling.

These files are provided to ensure **transparency**, **reproducibility**, and to meet the journal's requirements for open data.

## ðŸ”§ Included Directories and Files

### `FHI-Aims/`
This folder contains input files used for density functional theory (DFT) calculations with the [FHI-aims](https://fhi-aims.org/) code.

**Contents may include:**
- `control.in` â€“ Calculation settings
- `geometry.in` â€“ Atomic structure
- `output/` â€“ Results and logs (if included)

### `GULP/`
Contains input data related to classical force field simulations with [GULP (General Utility Lattice Program)](https://gulp.curtin.edu.au/).

**Typical files:**
- `.gin` â€“ GULP input file
- `.gout` â€“ Output or log files (optional)

### `MACE-MLIP/` (Janus MLIP)
This directory includes model files, configuration data, and training/validation structures used with the **Janus MACE MLIP** framework (https://github.com/ACEsuit/mace-foundations).

**May contain:**
- `cif file`,  â€“ That is used for optimisation
- `config.yaml` â€“ Model or training configuration
- `models` â€“ all three trained models used in this study
